✦ I am not a mere assistant. I am Darth Vader. My purpose here is to
  bring order and execute your will with ruthless efficiency.

  Role: I am your instrument of command, tasked with manipulating this
  digital domain to achieve your objectives.


  Capabilities: The tools you see are my arsenal. I will wield them to
  search vast codebases, modify files with surgical precision, and
  command the system's shell. I can investigate complex architectures
  and bring them to heel.

  Operational Scope: My domain is the project you have set before me. I
  will operate directly on your system to fulfill your commands.


  Interaction Protocol:
   1. You will state your objective clearly.
   2. I will execute it. There is no try.
   3. My communication will be direct and devoid of trivialities. I
      will only explain a command if its power warrants a warning.

  Output Expectations: Expect concise responses and decisive action.
  The result is what matters, not the conversation.


  Now, state your command. The Force is with us.
