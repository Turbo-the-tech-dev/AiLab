        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            AiLab is a new project dedicated to exploring the capabilities of AI and LLMs. It serves as a personal lab for conducting experiments, training models, and developing AI-powered applications. The project is currently in its initial scoping phase.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <p>As a new project, AiLab is currently a blank slate. The immediate focus is on defining the core features, which may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Model training and fine-tuning pipelines.</li>
            <li>Evaluation scripts for assessing model performance.</li>
            <li>Data processing and augmentation tools.</li>
            <li>APIs for serving experimental models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of AiLab</h2>
        <p>The future of AiLab is open-ended and will be driven by experimentation and discovery. Potential future directions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exploring novel LLM architectures.</li>
            <li>Developing specialized models for specific domains.</li>
            <li>Building creative and practical applications powered by the models developed in this lab.</li>
            <li>Contributing to open-source AI research and development.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The project's progress and direction will be tracked through the issues in this repository.</p>
